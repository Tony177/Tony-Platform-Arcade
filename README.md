# Tony177's Platform Arcade
Simple platform game created for educational purpose.

## Structure of the game

The game has the following implemented features:
- Movement and Physics Engine
- First chapter
- Death object
- Simple sound (picking coin and death)
- Multiple layer map 

Yet to be implemented:
- Other chapter (still unknown number)
- Enemies
- General Objective of the game
- Simple animation of the images

Ideas:
- Add some kind of lore
- Add a clear single and final enemy/objective
